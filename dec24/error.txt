/bin/sh: 1: arduino-cli: not found
Compilation failed with the following error: Command 'arduino-cli compile --fqbn Arduino uno result/result.ino --output-dir result' returned non-zero exit status 127.



The error message you're encountering, `/bin/sh: 1: arduino-cli: not found`, indicates that the `arduino-cli` command-line tool is not installed on your Raspberry Pi OS or is not in the system's PATH.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that `arduino-cli` is correctly installed and accessible from anywhere in your system. Here's how to install and set up `arduino-cli` on the Raspberry Pi:

1. **Install arduino-cli:**
   You can download the latest version of `arduino-cli` from the official GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Add arduino-cli to the PATH:**
   If the installation script doesn't automatically add `arduino-cli` to your path, you might need to do it manually.
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:/path-to-arduino-cli
   ```
   Replace `/path-to-arduino-cli` with the actual path to the `arduino-cli` binary. You might want to add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to ensure it persists across sessions.

3. **Update arduino-cli's core:**
   Before using `arduino-cli`, make sure to update the core libraries and install the necessary core for your Arduino board:
   ```sh
   arduino-cli core update-index
   arduino-cli core install arduino:avr
   ```
   This command installs the core for AVR-based Arduino boards; if you're using a different board, you might need to install a different core.

4. **Compile the Sketch:**
   Once `arduino-cli` is installed and configured, you should be able to compile your sketch with the command you provided:
   ```sh
   arduino-cli compile --fqbn {board_name} {file_path} --output-dir {result_folder}
   ```
   Ensure that `{board_name}` is the fully qualified board name as recognized by `arduino-cli`. For example, it could be `arduino:avr:uno` for an Arduino Uno.

5. **Generate the HEX file:**
   The compilation step should automatically generate a HEX file if it's successful. Usually, the HEX file will be stored in the specified output directory.

If you follow these steps and find that `arduino-cli` is still not found, ensure that the PATH is set correctly and that the `arduino-cli` binary has the executable permission (`chmod +x arduino-cli`). If you want to use Arduino IDE instead of arduino-cli, the command and setup process will differ.
